How to run the program:
1. Compile the source file after making sure all the files provided in the repository are present in one single folder
2. Run the newly created source.exe file AS ADMINISTRATOR.

The program uses the arp cache to get the count of the number of people connected to the router so admin rights have to be provided to the program.
The program should run on the router or if your laptop has hotspot you can connect devices to it to check the performance
